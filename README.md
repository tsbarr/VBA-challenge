# VBA Challenge: Stock Analysis

**Student name:** Tania Barrera

---

This repo contains my work for the second weekly challenge of the UofT SCS edX Data Bootcamp.

**Goal:** Use VBA to perform an analysis on generated stock market data that runs recursively on all worksheets of an Excel workbook.

## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

- Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.\*

## Results

The script contains 2 sub procedures: `Main()` and `CalculateYearData()`. To obtain the final solution, the sub procedure `Main()` loops through all the worksheets in the workbook and calls the sub procedure `CalculateYearData()` for each of them. 

The following screenshots show the final result after running the `Main()` sub procedure, with some column widths altered to improve readability of labels.


### 2018 worksheet

### 2019 worksheet

### 2020 worksheet

\* *Note:* Although the instructions do not indicate what to do for the conditional formatting if the change value is 0, I have made the background yellow for those cases, as seen in the 2020 worksheet screenshot. Another option would be for it to be red, because of inflation.
